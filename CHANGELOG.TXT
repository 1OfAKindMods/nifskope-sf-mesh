 == CHANGELOG ==

This is version 1.0 of NifSkope.

changes since 0.9.8:
 * User Interface
  - Expanded help menu and renamed "Reference Browser" to "Interactive Help" and made it come up when F1 is pressed.
  - Merged autodetect buttons into a single button which looks for every supported game so you can auto-detect all our games at the same time.
  - The custom paths you've specified will no longer be deleted by the autodetect button.
  - File names displayed in the load and save box should now always have the full path and show long file names on Windows.  They should also contain back slashes instead of forward slashes.
  - Added Vertex and Triangle Selection to bhkPackedNiTriStripsShape
  - Linux file select fix
  - The BSXFlags selection box works again
  - Improved FloatEdit to accept "<float_min>" and "<float_max>".
  - Added Draw Constraints option.
  - Added check if array is even enabled to "Update Array" spell
  - Created new icons for "Follow Link" and "Flags" spells just for fun.
  - Created an icon for "Array Update" and made the spell instant, so now arrays can be updated just by clicking the icon.
  - Made the Matrix4 edit spell "instant" so that the icon would appear next to the Matrix and the user won't have to drill down into the right-click menu.
  - Created some more amusing icons for the various view toolbar buttons.
  - Reformatted the insert block menu to make a little more sense.  "Havok" instead of "BHK," grouped other Bethesda and Firaxis nodes, etc.
  - Added version matching to XML checker.
  - Changed link editing so if you clear the value and press enter, the link changes to "None."  This way the user won't have to know that "-1" has a special meaning.
  - Fixed block-matching so it works for all versions, though it won't be any faster for old versions since early rejection can't be used.
  - Fixed NiControllerSequence links so that 0x0000FFFF also counts as "empty" instead of showing up as "invalid index"
  - Added the ability to specify what NIF version the new "blank" NIF is when NifSkope starts.
  - Changed relative path specifier to './'
  - Fixed issue where links in old files weren't mapped if the file didn't load completely.
 
 * 3D View
  - Added ability to center the view on the selected node or shape.  Select the node/shape and press the C key.
  - Made it so you can zoom in and out by right-dragging left and right as well as up and down.
  - Added Text Rendering when "Triangles" is selected on the bhkNiTriStripsShape data.  If the top is selected all triangles are numbered if a specific one is selected then only that triangle index is shown.
  - Removed triangle sorting of alpha meshes because none of the games or official scene viewers actually seem to do this.  Improves display of Oblivion hair meshes.
  - Fixed, added, or improved several Havok Constraint visuals.
  - Added support for displaying textures in NiTextureProperty (Nif ver. 3.x)
  - Made selection lines look much less flickery by increasing the line width to 1.5 before drawing them.
  - Added visualization for old style collision boxes.  Lumped it in with "Havok" since it's the same idea as a Havok box shape.
 
 * Spells
  - Added "Create Convex Shape" spell - currently, using QHull which is not on SVN due to licensing.
  - Update Center/Radius" spell now respects CF_VOLATILE and Oblivion simple center searching methods.
  - Enhanced LimitedHingeHelper spell to every constraint
  - "Edit UV" is applicable only when there are texture coordinates present and fixed bug which could lead to crashing.
 
 * Import/Export
  - 3ds and OBJ import updated so that all the NiTriShapes will be attached to whatever NiNode is selected in the tree view, similar to the old right-click->Import method.
  - Fixed 3ds import for shapes with multiple materials.
  - Optimized 3ds import a bit so that group nodes will only be created when there is more than one material in a shape.
  - Updated Import 3ds so that it creates a "Scene Root" node which all object nodes are attached to, rather than creating a NIF file with many roots.
  - Fixed a the same bug in 3ds import as was fixed in OBJ import where "Has UV" was not being set properly.
  - Fixed OBJ and 3ds import and export so that NiImage and NiTexture are created in 3.x files, and are detected during OBJ export.
  - Fixed a bug that was causing the "Has UV" bool not to be set correctly when an OBJ file was imported.
  
 * NIF Compatibility
  - Added partial support for the following new games: Loki, Pro Cycling Manager, Shin Megami Tensei
  - Fixed a bug that made NifSkope fail to load the 3.3.0.13 file.
  - Fixed problem with version 3.03 conditions in the XML.  Version 3.1 files can be read again.
 
 * Misc. 
  - GCC build fixes.
  - Added check for empty QFileSystemWatcher, this removes the nasty qWarning

  - anisotropic texture filtering (check the antialias checkbox in the render
    settings dialog)
  - fixed another issue with update tangent space, should look better now
  - the havok strips are now drawn like they appear in the tescs
    if you encounter the spider web effect use the new unstich strips spell
    on the NiTriStripsData block
  - the skin partition spell now also accepts nifs below 20.x.x.x
  - added an option to save and restore the 3d view's rotation, position
    and distance
  - rotations can now also be edited as axis angle pairs
  - added a widget style sheet (style.qss)
    if you want you can customize the look and feel of NifSkope through this
    style sheet
  - fixed an issue with the ipc socket
    NifSkope should open now at least one window regardless of any personal
    firewall settings

changes since 0.9.3:
  - support for nifs below version 4 (StarTrek: Bridge Commander)
  - comprehensive render settings dialog
  - texture folder auto setup
  - highlighting of individual vertices, normals, triangles, etc.
  - added a spell to combine equal properties and another spell to make the properties
    unique again
  - improved skin partitioning
  - fixed calculation and rendering of binormals, under some circumstances the
    direction of the binormals was flipped if you encounter this problem updating
    the tangent space again should solve it
  - fixed flag spell
  - fixed LOD switching
  - fixed Morrowind morph animations
  - template column integrated into type column
  - switched to Qt 4.2


changes since 0.9.2:
  - for enumerated values (eg: havok material) nifskope now displays the option name
    instead of an integer value
    also the type column's tooltip now displays the type's description and all the
    available options
  - the version tag syntax in the xml description was slighty changed to be more intuitive
  - clicking in the 3d view now cycles through the items below the mouse


changes since 0.9.1:
  - texture paths are now converted to windows notation
    because otherwise Oblivion doesn't find textures located within .bsa archives
  - stripifier now outputs single strips
    because CivIV draws only the first strip
	

changes since 0.8.8:
  - now plays embedded animation sequences (good examples are the doors
    and some traps from oblivion)
  - thanks to tapzn for implementing bspline animation interpolators
  - new spell: attach .kf
    - this spell takes an external animation sequence and attaches it
      to the nif
    - this way it's now possible to view the creature and character animations
      in NifSkope
  - fixed havok sorter: now sorts constraints and bhkNiTriStripsShape too
  - updated the skin partitioner: now automatically reduces vertex influences
    and splits large partitions into smaller parts
  - some small tweaks:
    - paste branch now automatically parents ninode branches to the selected ninode
    - ipc over udp ensures that new NifSkope windows are allways opened in the same
      application instance (this makes the 'new window' workaround obsolete when
      copying and pasting between nifs on windows platform)
      note that this works by opening a local udp server socket. communication on
      this socket is limited to local host only. so it shouldn't be a security issue.

  - havok blocks will be ordered automatically
  - some hot keys for the spells
  - fixed obj import/export (textures,collision meshes)
